## Description

This project [Street Style Landing Page]() was built using Semantic HTML and CSS. My main aim while building this project was to learn basics of HTML tags & CSS classes. While building this webpage I faced difficulties in postioning the navlist items & images. The problem was solved using positions & Flexbox and its properties like justify-content, align-items, align-self, etc. The Project was completed under guidance of [Hitesh Choudhary](https://github.com/hiteshchoudhary), CTO Ineuron
